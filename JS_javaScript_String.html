    <h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>
    <p>
      You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes
      surrounding the string:
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      let answerOne = "It's alright";
      let answerTwo = "He is called 'Johnny'";
      let answerThree = 'He is called "Johnny" ';
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        answerOne + "<br>" + answerTwo + "<br>" + answerThree;
    </script>
  </body>
